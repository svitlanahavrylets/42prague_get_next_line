Whispers of bytes in midnight air,
Lines unfold with hidden care.
Read me slowly, piece by piece,
Until the final newline's cease.

42 dreams in tiny chunks,
Broken buffers, tricky funks.
Static hearts remember all—
Even what the reads can't call.

One more line before I go,
Catch my \n and let it flow.
EOF will greet you with a sigh,
Return me NULL, and say goodbye.
